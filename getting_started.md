# Getting Started on DDF

The DDF initative is comprised of several components.  Depending on a person's role in an organization and level of understanding of DDF, there may be different starting points.  

Please review this Adoption Took Kit for guidance, with an introductory video on how to use the Adoption Toolkit. 

# CDISC Unified Study Definitions Model (USDM)
The backbone of the DDF initative is the creation of the **Unified Study Definitions Model**, developed by CDISC.  

The USDM contains both new and existing standards, and also provides common vocabulary, reusable designs, industry best practices, standards, and general implementation guidance for solution archiects.  

The USDM serves as the standard model for creating a **Study Definitions Repository**, which is a novel central component aimed at facilitating the exchange of structured study definitions across clinical systems using technical and data standards.

To learn more and get access to the USDM documentation, please go to the [CDISC Digital Data Flow website](https://www.cdisc.org/ddf). 

# Study Definitions Repository (SDR) Reference Implementation

Transcelerate, along with Accenture, Microsoft, and other life sciences technology vendors have developed a working model of the Study Definitions Repository based on the USDM called the Study Definitions Repository Reference Implementation.  

The SDR Reference Implementation is being deployed as open-source, and is meant to be vendor agnostic.  The goal of having an open-source, vendor agnostic solution is to create a platform for both innovation and collaborative interoperability across the industry. 

## Accessing the SDR Reference Implementation

There are two pathways for accessing the SDR Reference Implementation.  
1. **GitHub** - Accessing the SDR Reference Implementation codebase for the purposes of installing the SDR Reference Implementation locally on a company's technology environment
2. **AZURE** (need to rename) - Accessing the working model of the SDR Reference Implementation
