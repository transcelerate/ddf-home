## Install Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition

Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition (hereafter Visual Studio) is free to use for public Open Source Initiative projects, which DDF is!

- https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/ - Visual Studio 2022 Community
    - Choose "ASP.NET and web development" and "Azure development"

From here, you have a few options - you can either clone the repo right from Visual Studio, or download a zip of the code

## Opening from GitHub

## Opening the downloaded solution

- Download the ddf-sdr-api zip at https://github.com/transceleratebiopharmainc/ddf-sdr-api/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
- Extract the zip and open the `src\TransCelerate.SDR.sln` using Visual Studio
  - You may need to install the .NET Core 3.1 runtime, which will be automatically suggested to you
