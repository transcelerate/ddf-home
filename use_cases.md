# Welcome to the Digital Study Design Use Case Library

The Library is a curated collection of potential use cases developed as part of the Transcelerate Digital Data Flow (DDF) initiative. It is a living resource intended to evolve as new capabilities, standards, and regulatory guidance emerge. Feedback and contributions are welcome to ensure it remains relevant and practical.

## Purpose of the Library
- Establish a shared understanding of the scope and benefits of Digital Study Design adoption,
- Provide a Rosetta Stone of definition and taxonomy for sharing Digital Study Design concepts between stakeholders, and
- Postulate a vision -- not necessarily The Vision -- of what Done looks like when USDM- compliant Digital Study Design is adopted across the clinical research ecosystem.

## Structure of the Library
- The Library is based upon the UML Use Case format
- Use cases are represented as ovals broken down in to a hierarchy of Category, Class, and System of Interest.
- Each related collection of use cases (i.e. System of Interest) captures the trigger, primary scenario, result, and key actors or systems involved.
- To promote consistency, a Glossary is included to define the terms used throughout the library.

Please Note:
The work presented here details common elements and examples of factors that organizations may encounter when initiating a Digital Study Design/Digital Data Flow transformation. It is not intended to outline the only possibilities for achieving scalable Digital Study Design and does not constitute a recommendation to adopt or approve a particular system or a systems with particular elements or features.

Each organization must decide for itself if different, alternate approaches may work better for its unique circumstances.?The decision to consider and to proceed with a Digital Study Design/Digital Data Flow trans-formative effort is the sole prerogative and at the complete discretion of individual organizations as informed by their internal strategies, assessments, and approval processes.
