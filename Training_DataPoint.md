## From Clinical Strategy to Filing: Automating the Clinical Data Flow Journey

<br>
This training aims to show clinical study team members their involvement with a clinical data point through the stages from strategy through marketing authorization submission. 
<br>
The course introduces the CDISC USDM (Unified Study Definitions Model), a standardized reference architecture that supports the digitization and automation of clinical trial protocols.  While the USDM is one approach, Digital Data Flow can also be achieved using other models. 
<br>

## **Course Description**

<p></p>
In this training course, you’ll see how a clinical data point moves from strategy through to marketing authorization submission —and how every contributor plays a key role in that end-to-end journey. 
<p></p>
The video and downloadable schematic shows the full vision of DDF, highlighting the interdependencies on other roles as we move from clinician portfolio building to submission writing, and how each step is related.

<p></p>
This course is designed for anyone involved in the clinical data lifecycle, especially those who contribute to or rely on the Digital Data Flow. 
<p></p>
Whether you're a clinician building a study portfolio, writing content for a marketing authorization submission, supporting data standards, or part of the data transformation and delivery process, this training will help you see how your work connects to the bigger picture. 
<p></p>
It’s ideal for roles across: 
<p></p>
  - Clinical content development 
<p></p>
  - Data standards and governance 
<p></p>
  - Study setup and design 
<p></p>
  - Data transformation and delivery 
<p></p>
  - Regulatory and marketing authorization submission teams 
<p></p> 
Even if you're not hands-on with data every day, understanding how it flows digitally can help you collaborate better cross-functionally and add more value to the process.

Before taking this course, learners should have:  
<p></p>
- A basic understanding of clinical trial processes (e.g., study design, data collection, and marketing authorization submission workflows)
<p></p>
- Familiarity with roles such as clinical strategic lead, clinical scientist, medical scientist, medical monitor, medical writer, study designer/builder, data manager, clinical data programmer, statistician, statistical programmer or regulatory strategist, or safety lead.
<p></p>
- A general awareness of clinical data standards (e.g., CDISC, SDTM) is helpful but not required. 
<p></p>
- No technical background needed—this course focuses on concepts and connections, not programming.

<p></p>
You've just completed the training From Clinical Strategy to Filing: Automating the Clinical Data Flow Journey. 
<p></p>
We walked through each key stage, including clinician portfolio building and marketing authorization submission writing.   
<p></p>
You saw how a data point, like a demographic field, flows through various functions—connecting people, processes, systems, and deliverables moving away from the document paradigm, as documents are auto-created from digital data (single source of truth). 
<p></p>
We emphasized the importance of collaboration over working in silos, and how every role plays a part in the bigger picture. With tools like the flow diagram and the USDM structure, you now have a clearer understanding of how data move with purpose and consistency. 
<p></p>
If you’d like to go deeper, additional training and resources are available to build on what you’ve learned.  
<p></p>
Thank you for joining us—and remember: your piece of the puzzle helps power the entire flow.
