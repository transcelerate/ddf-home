<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>
<p></p>
This course is designed for anyone involved in the clinical data lifecycle, especially those who contribute to or rely on the Digital Data Flow. 
<p></p>
Whether you're a clinician building a study portfolio, writing content for a marketing authorization submission, supporting data standards, or part of the data transformation and delivery process, this training will help you see how your work connects to the bigger picture. 
<p></p>
Itâ€™s ideal for roles across: 
<p></p>
  - Clinical content development 
<p></p>
  - Data standards and governance 
<p></p>
  - Study setup and design 
<p></p>
  - Data transformation and delivery 
<p></p>
  - Regulatory and marketing authorization submission teams 
<p></p> 
Even if you're not hands-on with data every day, understanding how it flows digitally can help you collaborate better cross-functionally and add more value to the process.

## **What is the objective of the DDF initiative?**

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>
<p></p>
The objective of DDF is to automate and expedite the Study Start-Up process by revolutionizing how data flows across clinical trial systems, beginning with upstream (e.g., study builder) and downstream (e.g., electronic data capturing/EDC, clinical trial management system/CTMS) clinical systems.

<p></p>
TransCelerate has collaborated to develop an open-source, vendor agnostic, <strong>study definition repository</strong> (SDR) reference implementation. The SDR's basis is a Unified Study Definitions Model (USDM), developed by CDISC, that standardizes the data model for protocol study definitions..
<p></p>
The SDR reference implementation enables the format of information from a digitized protocol and other sources to be standardized and stored centrally. This allows the information to be passed to systems through application programming interfaces (APIs) used for study execution and data collection and reused throughout the clinical development lifecycle.  
<p></p>
In summary, DDF will combine data standards and a novel technology to enable the flow of data across all systems involved in the design and execution of a clinical trial.

<summary>Additional details regarding the <strong>USDM</strong></summary>
<p></p>
To create a consistent, comprehensive, and structured representation of a study definition as described in text in clinical trial protocols, a <strong>Unified Study Definitions Model</strong> has been developed by <strong>CDISC</strong>. 
<p></p>
The USDM contains both new and existing standards, and also provides common vocabulary, reusable designs, industry best practices, standards, and general implementation guidance for solution architects.

<summary>Additional details regarding the <strong>SDR Reference Implementation</strong></summary>
<p></p>
The <strong>Study Definitions Repository</strong> is a novel central component aimed at facilitating the exchange of structured study definitions across clinical systems using both technical and data standards.
<p></p>
Transcelerate, along with Accenture, Microsoft, and other life sciences technology vendors have developed a working instance of the Study Definitions Repository based on the USDM called the <strong>Study Definitions Repository (SDR) Reference Implementation</strong>.  
<p></p>
The SDR Reference Implementation has been designed and developed to be open-source and vendor agnostic.  The goal of having an open-source, vendor agnostic solution is to create a platform for both innovation and collaborative interoperability across the industry.

## **What are the benefits of the DDF initiative?**
<p></p>
<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>
<p></p>
Many companies still manually conduct many of the activities that support the process of moving data from protocol development through clinical trial execution and beyond.
<p></p>
Digital Data Flow (DDF) benefits include:  
<p></p>
- minimized process hand-offs, data re-entry, and data format inconsistencies across study start-up and execution
<p></p>
- a foundation for data exchange and interoperability between clinical technology systems, leading to greater compatibility among systems, flexibility for sponsors, and improved clinical trial efficiencies
<p></p>
- a more seamless flow of data, leading to accelerated study start-up and further enabling trial automation for sponsors and research partners, and
<p></p>
- data format harmonization that can support greater interoperability and spark innovation within the research and development ecosystem and across the clinical trial solutions landscape.

## **Who does the DDF initiative help?**

<details>
<summary>Click for answer</summary>
<p></p>
The DDF initiative will help many organizations, including pharmaceutical companies, CROs, standards organizations, upstream and downstream clinical vendors, sites, regulatory agencies, technology companies, and the open-source pharmaceutical and IT communities.
<p></p>
With DDF, organizations across the R&D ecosystem will be able to leverage the open-source code of the SDR reference implementation and develop a framework to deploy their own SDR implementations.
