# Defining Open Source
Open source is a term that originally referred to open source software (OSS). Open source software is code that is designed to be publicly accessible.  

A platform supporting open source allows anyone to:
- Distribute the code as they see fit
- Access the code
- Contribute to the code (i.e. openly review, suggest changes, etc.).

The Study Definitions Repository (SDR) Reference Implementation has been deployed onto GitHub, a popular platform for Open source.  Having the SDR RI developed and deployed as open source and vendor agnostic supports collaboration, transparency, and innovation across the industry. 

# GitHub Access

To use GitHub, a person needs to first create an account. 

Go to [https://github.com/join](https://github.com/join) and follow the instructions to create an account.  To access and use GitHub for DDF is free of charge. 

Once a user account is created, click [here](https://github.com/transceleratebiopharmainc) to access the DDF GitHub page. 

# GitHub Navigation

The hierarchy in GitHub allows for an "organization", which then allows the "organization" to create one or more repositories, which is where specific inforamtion and code is stored. 

For the DDF initative, the top level "organization" is **TransCelerate**.  There are four repositories that hold information and code about the SDR Reference Implementation. 

The GitHub platform allows for users to openly engage with each other in support of accessing and contributing to open-source software.  The user interface in GitHub may be confusing at first glance.  

Here is a quick summary of the GitHub user interface.
