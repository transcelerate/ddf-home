The Study Definitions Repository (SDR) Reference Implementation is a working model of a Study Definitions Repository that has been developed based on the CDISC Unified Study Definitions Model (USDM).  

For details and documents regarding the USDM, please go to the [CDISC Digital Data Flow website](https://www.cdisc.org/ddf).

# SDR RI Codebase & GitHub
The SDR Reference Implementation has been deployed as open-source, and is meant to be vendor agnostic.  The goal of having an open-source, vendor agnostic solution is to create a platform for both innovation and collaborative interoperability across the industry.

GitHub is the platform where the SDR RI code is published.  New to GitHub? Click [Getting Started with GitHub] for some guidance on accessing and using GitHub.
