## Draft / Beta Status

While this repository and the associated code repositories (see [Getting Started on DDF](#getting-started-on-ddf)) below) are public, this is a soft launch, and the Digital Data Flow (DDF) reference implementation and this document repository should be considered in a beta/draft state.

## Introduction

The Digital Data Flow (DDF) initiative aims to modernize clinical trials by enabling a digital workflow that allows for automated creation of study content and configuration of study systems to support clinical trial execution. See [What is DDF?](overview.md) for more information on the overview, objectives and benefits of DDF.

## Disclaimer

The materials shared in this repository are intended to be used solely for understanding DDF and the SDR reference implementation, and assisting the deployment of the reference implementation either locally or on Microsoft Azure. Future cloud providers are being considered but not yet on a roadmap.

Nothing in these materials is intended to guide the study definition process or configuration of clinical systems. Results of those activities are solely the responsibility of the user of the scripts and not the developers.
