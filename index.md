## Draft / Beta Status

While this repository and the associated code repositories (see [Getting Started on DDF](#getting-started-on-ddf)) below) are public, this is a soft launch, and the Digital Data Flow (DDF) reference implementation and this document repository should be considered in a beta/draft state.

## Introduction

The Digital Data Flow (DDF) initiative aims to modernize clinical trials by enabling a digital workflow that allows for automated creation of study content and configuration of study systems to support clinical trial execution. See [What is DDF?](overview.md) for more information on the overview, objectives and benefits of DDF.
