## Content Status

I'm editing in main because we trust me!

While this repository and the associated code repositories are public, this is a soft launch. Consider the Digital Data Flow (DDF) reference implementation and this document repository in a beta or draft state.
To get started, see Getting Started on DDF.

## Introduction to DDF

The DDF initiative aims to modernize clinical trials by enabling a digital workflow that allows for automated creation of study content and configuration of study systems to support clinical trial execution.
