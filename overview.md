# DDF Overview

## **What is the Digital Data Flow initiative?**

The Digital Data Flow (DDF) initiative aims to modernize clinical trials by enabling a digital workflow that allows for automated creation of study content and configuration of study systems to support clinical trial execution. This initiative will establish a foundation for a future state of automated and dynamic readiness that can transform the drug development process.

## **What is the objective of the DDF initiative?**

The objective of DDF is to automate and expedite the Study Start-Up process by revolutionizing how data flows across clinical trial systems, beginning with upstream (e.g., study builder) and downstream (e.g., electronic data capturing/EDC, clinical trial management system/CTMS) clinical systems.

TransCelerate has collaborated on the development of an open-source, vendor agnostic, study definition repository (SDR) reference implementation, based on a Unified Study Definitions Model (USDM), developed by CDISC, that standardizes protocol study definitions.

The SDR reference implementation enables the format of information from a digitized protocol and other sources to be standardized and stored centrally, which then allows the information to be passed to systems through application programming interfaces (APIs) that are used for study execution and data collection and reused throughout the clinical development lifecycle.  

In summary, DDF will combine data standards and a new technology to enable the flow of data across all systems involved in the design and execution of a clinical trial.  

## **What are the benefits of the DDF initiative?**

Currently many companies still conduct many manual activities to support the process of moving data from protocol development through clinical trial execution and beyond.

Digital Data Flow (DDF) benefits include:  

- Minimized process hand-offs, data re-entry, and data format inconsistencies across Study Start-Up and execution  
- A foundation for data exchange and interoperability between clinical technology systems, leading to greater compatibility among systems, flexibility to sponsors, and improved clinical trial efficiencies
- A more seamless flow of data leading to accelerated Study Start-Up, and further enabling trials automation for sponsors and research partners
- Harmonization of the data format that can support greater interoperability and spark innovation within the R&D ecosystem and across the clinical trial solutions landscape

## **Who does the initiative help?**

This initiative will assist many organizations, including pharmaceutical companies, CROs, standards organizations, upstream and downstream clinical vendors, sites, regulatory agencies, technology companies, and the open-source pharmaceutical and IT communities.

With DDF, organizations across the R&D ecosystem will be able to leverage the open-source code of the SDR reference implementation and develop a framework to deploy their own SDR implementations, that will enable efficiencies in clinical operations to help get medicines to patients faster.
