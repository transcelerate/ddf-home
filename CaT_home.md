<p></p>
The DDF Connectathon is a virtual event for sponsor companies, life sciences technology vendors, CROs, and other stakeholders to experiment and test how well their applications align to the <b>CDISC Unified Study Definitions Model (USDM)</b> and the connectivity and interoperability of these applications with the <b>Study Definitions Repository Reference Implementation (SDR RI)</b>.

<u>Principles of the DDF Connectathon</u>
<p></p>
The DDF Connectathon event focuses on practical ways that companies have and can use the SDR RI and the USDM, and is not meant to be used as an application showcase. 
<p></p>
A key principle of the Connectathon is that it is a safe place to explore options for connectivity, innovation, and interoperatbility. Collaboration with and across different stakeholders is highly encouraged.

<p></p>
- better plan for future SDR RI and USDM development through stakeholder stress testing and feedback on the latest release
<p></p>
- gather feedback from stakeholders on features that may not have been previously considered, and
<p></p>
- cultivate and foster a DDF open-source community through cross-industry collaborations.
