# Getting Started on DDF

The DDF initiative is comprised of several components.  Depending on a person's role in an organization and level of understanding of DDF, there may be different starting points.  

To get started, please review details below regarding the **CDISC Unifed Study Definitions Model (USDM)** and the **Study Definitions Repository (SRD) Reference Implementation**. 

## CDISC Unified Study Definitions Model (USDM)

The framework for the DDF initiative is the **Unified Study Definitions Model**, developed by CDISC.  

The USDM contains both new and existing standards, and also provides common vocabulary, reusable designs, industry best practices, standards, and general implementation guidance for solution architects.  

The USDM serves as a guideline for creating a **Study Definitions Repository**, which is a novel central component aimed at facilitating the exchange of structured study definitions across clinical systems using technical and data standards.

To learn more and get access to the USDM documentation, please go to the [CDISC Digital Data Flow website](https://www.cdisc.org/ddf).

Watch a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=082onW7jhe4&t=2s) describing the USDM.

## Study Definitions Repository (SDR) Reference Implementation

Transcelerate, along with Accenture, Microsoft, and other life sciences technology vendors have developed a working model of the Study Definitions Repository based on the USDM called the **Study Definitions Repository Reference Implementation**.  

The SDR Reference Implementation has been deployed as open-source, and is meant to be vendor agnostic.  The goal of having an open-source, vendor agnostic solution is to create a platform for both innovation and collaborative interoperability across the industry.

## DDF Adoption Toolkit
An Adoption Tool Kit has been created to help stakeholders faciliate change management and adoption of DDF in their organizations.  Please see the table below to reference the applicable content.
