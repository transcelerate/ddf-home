## Collaborating Across Initiatives

Currently, multiple initiatives are focusing on different aspects of protocol digitization.  

By aligning on content and working together, the collaboration across these initiatives amplifies the value of a Digital Protocol. 

The DDF Initative is collaborating with the following organizations and initiatives:
- ICH - M11 CeSHaRP
- CDISC - USDM
- Vulcan HL7 FHIR
