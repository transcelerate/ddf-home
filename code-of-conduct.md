## Our Pledge

As members, contributors, and leaders, we pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.
We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behaviors that contribute to a positive environment for our community include

- demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience, and
- focusing on what's best, not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include

- using sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- public or private harassment
- publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
- publishing names of third parties that a member company collaborates with, and
- other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior. They will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that don't align with this Code of Conduct. When appropriate, they will communicate reasons for moderation decisions.

# Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all community spaces. It also applies when an individual officially represents the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting on an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

# Enforcement

Report instances of abuse, harassment, or other unacceptable behaviors to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at [DDF@transcelerate.com](mailto:DDF@transcelerate.com?subject=Code%20of%20Conduct%20Issues). 

Community leaders responsible for enforcement:
- will review and investigate all complaints promptly and fairly, and
- must respect the privacy and security of those who report an incident.
