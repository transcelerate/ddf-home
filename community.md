## Community

DDF aims to modernize clinical trials by enabling a digital workflow that allows for automated creation of study content and configuration of study systems to support clinical trial execution. 

The DDF community is about working together toward continuous improvement, learning from each other, and sharing information.

## DDF Community Values
The DDF Community values provide the foundation for the success of the DDF initative.
    
- **Community first**
  - We're here to work together publicly for the common goal of progressing interoperatbility across the R&D ecosystem.  

- **Be inclusive**
  - Being a part of this community is a privilege, not a right.  Be respectful of all viewpoints and learn from each other

- **Innovate**
  - Exploring ideas with others only makes the community stronger.  All thoughts are worth a discussion and you should feel comfortable to share any ideas.
