# DDF Community

DDF aims to modernize clinical trials by enabling a digital workflow that allows for automated creation of study content and configuration of study systems to support clinical trial execution.

The DDF community is about working together toward continuous improvement, learning from each other, and sharing information.

## DDF Community Values

The DDF Community Values provide the foundation for the DDF initiative's success.
