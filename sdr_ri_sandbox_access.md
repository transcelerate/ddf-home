The Study Definitions Repository (SDR) Reference Implementation is a working model of a Study Definitions Repository that has been developed based on the **CDISC Unified Study Definitions Model (USDM)**.

For details and documents regarding the USDM, please go to the [CDISC Digital Data Flow website](https://www.cdisc.org/ddf).

The materials shared here are intended to be used solely for understanding DDF and the SDR Reference Implementation.

These materials are not intended to guide the study definition process or configuration of clinical systems. Results of those activities are solely the responsibility of the user of the scripts and not the developers.

## SDR RI Sandbox Environment Overview

The SDR Reference Implementation has been deployed as open-source, and is meant to be vendor agnostic.  The goal of having an open-source, vendor agnostic solution is to create a platform for both innovation and collaborative interoperability across the industry.

As an outcome of the development process, a working model of the SDR Reference Implementation has been setup on **Microsoft Azure**.

To facilitate the adoption of DDF, this Microsoft Azure environment, or **SDR RI Sandbox Environment**, is available for those who are interested in leveraging this environment to view what has been developed, and test out API connections with the working model of the SDR without having to deploy the SDR Reference Implementation codebase locally.

## Using the SDR RI Sandbox Environment

The SDR Reference Implementation Sandbox environment will be made available through a request process for users who wish to access the environment.
