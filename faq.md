# DDF Initiative FAQ
<details>
<summary>What is the Digital Data Flow initiative?</summary>

The Digital Data Flow (DDF) initiative aims to modernize clinical trials by enabling
a digital workflow that allows for automated creation of study content and
configuration of study systems to support clinical trial execution. This initiative will
establish a foundation for a future state of automated and dynamic readiness
that can transform the drug development process

</details>

<details>
<summary>What is the objective of the DDF initiative?</summary>

The objective of DDF is to automate and expedite the Study Start-Up process by
revolutionizing how data flows across clinical trial systems, beginning with
upstream (e.g., study builder) and downstream (e.g., electronic data
capturing/EDC, clinical trial management system/CTMS) clinical systems.

TransCelerate has collaborated on the development of an open-source, vendor
agnostic, study definition repository (SDR) reference implementation, based on a Unified Study Definitions Model (USDM), developed by CDISC, that standardizes protocol study definitions.

The SDR reference implementation will enable the format of information from a
digitized protocol and other sources to be standardized, which then allows the
information to be passed to systems through application programming interfaces
(APIs) that are used for study execution and data collection, and reused
throughout the clinical development lifecycle.

In summary, DDF will combine data standards and a new technology to enable
the flow of data across all systems involved in the design and execution of a
clinical trial.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What are the benefits of the DDF initiative?</summary>

Digital Data Flow (DDF) benefits include

- Minimized process hand-offs, data re-entry, and data format
inconsistencies across Study Start-Up and execution
- A foundation for data exchange and interoperability between clinical
technology systems, leading to greater compatibility among systems,
flexibility to sponsors, and improved clinical trial efficiencies
- A more seamless flow of data leading to accelerated Study Start-Up,
and further enabling trials automation for sponsors and research
partners
- Harmonization of the data format that can support greater
interoperability and spark innovation within the R&D ecosystem and
across the clinical trial solutions landscape

</details>

<details>
<summary>Who does the initiative help?</summary>

This initiative will assist many organizations, including pharmaceutical companies, CROs, standards organizations, upstream and downstream clinical vendors, sites, regulatory agencies, technology companies, and the open-source
pharmaceutical and IT communities. With DDF, organizations across the R&D
ecosystem will be able to leverage the open-source code of the SDR reference
implementation and develop a framework to deploy their own SDR
implementations.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Who within a company is impacted by DDF?</summary>

Roles impacted by DDF would be study managers, study protocol authors,
medical writers, data management stakeholders concerned with ensuring
consistent use of standards, clinical systems (IT) stakeholders, data managers
and clinicians primarily accountable for a study.

</details>

# DDF Long Term Success FAQ

<details>
<summary>What is the data standards solution and technology that will enable DDF?</summary>

Today’s manual processes with multiple human and technical hand offs are not
a sustainable, effective way to approach clinical development. For the future,
DDF envisions the digitization and automation of the flow of information to keep up with increasing demands of clinical development.

The DDF initiative involves a multi-faceted program that includes
collaborating with the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC)
to develop a standardized data model and working with lead collaborators and other stakeholders to develop the SDR reference implementation. The approach comprises of the following:

- **Standards Collaboration**: CDISC has developed a new protocol
study definition standard, called the Unified Study Definition Model (USDM),
with key stakeholders including engaged technology companies and
vendors
- **Study Definitions Repository Reference Implementation**: The Study Definitions Repository is a novel central component aimed at facilitating the exchange of structured study definitions across clinical systems using technical and data standards.  

The SDR Reference Implementation is a working model of the Study Definitions Repository based on the USDM, and has been deployed as open-source, and is meant to be vendor agnostic.

</details>

<details>
<summary>How will TransCelerate help the R&D ecosystem prepare for DDF?</summary>

Multiple stakeholders across the R&D ecosystem will be impacted. Particular
focus is being paid to sponsors, technology solution providers and the many
stakeholders within each.  Efforts to facilitate adoption and help stakeholders
(including sponsor companies and up/downstream vendor community) prepare
will run across three active categories of work: analyzing, educating, and
enabling stakeholder readiness for the digital data flow execution.

</details>

<details>
<summary>How will the initiative ensure long-term sustainability and outcome driven success?</summary>

The SDR reference implementation governance model has been designed to
support long-term sustainability. As the SDR reference implementation matures,
governance will transition from the SDR reference implementation governance
committee to a formal SDR reference implementation governance entity. This
multi-stakeholder governance entity would be a separate organization whose
stakeholders and objectives are aligned with the concepts of interoperability
and vendor agnostic access. It may require additional advisory committees or
members to engage stakeholders such as additional SSOs (e.g, ICH (M11), HL7),
technology solution providers, systems integrators, and other stakeholders.

The intent is to follow open-source principles wherever possible, to provide
transparency and involvement in developing source code for connecting
applications. The choice of licensing approaches is critical to provide an
incentive for participation by the developer and vendor communities via
commercialization of software applications or related services (such as training, documentation, integration, or support).

</details>

<details>
<summary>How will TransCelerate support and position DDF for success?</summary>

TransCelerate is uniquely positioned to catalyze this change by sponsoring and
leading the collaborative project to develop an open-source technology,
vendor-agnostic solution in collaboration with technology organizations, and
corresponding data standards in collaboration with SSOs.

# CDISC Unified Study Definitions Model FAQ

<details>
<summary>What is the Unified Study Definition Model (USDM)?</summary>

The study definition (as described in text in clinical trial protocols, CDISC data and technology (API) standards) will be augmented with a consistent,
comprehensive, and structured representation and a new standard will be
defined. To this end, the Unified Study Definition Model (USDM) has been created, and study definitions in the study definition repository (SDR)  conforms to this data standard.

The USDM has been developed by CDISC. The USDM will include a class diagram describing the study design elements, their attributes, and
relationships between them. The USDM defines all elements needed to
construct a study definition, from high-level study design elements (e.g., study phase, indication, objectives and endpoints, eligibility criteria) to detailed study design elements included in the schedule of activities and assessments.

</details>

<details>
<summary>How do standards developed through DDF relate to other existing standards?
</summary>

The idea is not to create new models, but to pull together all existing standards. DDF’s collaboration with CDISC will define success from a standards perspective. 

CDISC has led development and maintenance of standards used by the
Digital Data Flow solution. By unifying existing standards and developing new
standards with input from all potential end users, we enable the accessibility,
interoperability, and reusability of protocol-related study definitions data.
In addiiton to the development of new standards, DDF will use existing standards where they exist - controlled terminology for phase of a trial is an example.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Where can I access the USDM?</summary>

The Unified Study Definition Model (USDM) has been developed by CDISC.  To access the details of the USDM, go to https://www.cdisc.org/ddf. 

</details>

# Study Definitions Repository (SDR) FAQ

</details>

<details>
<summary>What is the study definition repository (SDR)?</summary>

A study definition repository (SDR) is a novel central component aimed at
facilitating the exchange of structured study definitions across upstream systems (e.g., study builder) and downstream clinical systems (e.g., electronic data capturing/EDC, clinical trial management system/CTMS) used to execute a clinical research study. It uses technical and data standards developed by CDISC.

The SDR reference implementation demonstrates implementation of data and
technical standards defined by CDISC as the first step toward digital data flow and will catalyze the broader development of an ecosystem of connecting products. The SDR reference implementation will demonstrates the ability to flow digital study definition information between systems through API connections to systems such as study builders, EDCs, and CTMS, with the opportunity for many additional use cases to follow. However, these systems will not be part of the SDR reference implementation per se, rather they could demonstrate the ability to send (e.g., study builders) and receive (e.g., EDC and CTMS) metadata.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Is the SDR reference implementation intended to be a commercial product?</summary>

No, the SDR reference implementation will not be a fully functional product but
rather will be used to demonstrate and test ecosystem connectivity and
interoperability. The SDR reference implementation will hopefully encourage
others to develop innovative commercial products. By creating a reference
implementation of an SDR, we hope to motivate vendors to align their products
with it and thus incorporate the new data standards, and sponsors will be more
readily able to adopt an SDR.

</details>

<details>
<summary>How would vendors use the SDR reference implementation?</summary>

Wendors will have the ability to connect to the SDR Reference Implementation to test compatibility and utilize the code through open source licensing. Vendors can also take advantage of the interoperability functionality by deploying their own version in a cloud/Software as a Service (SaaS) model or by building their own compliant SDR using the technology of their choosing. 

In addition, sponsors can create an SDR based on the SDR reference implementation for their own use, adding new functionality if desired, with the ability to contribute to further development of the SDR reference implementation.
