# DDF Initiative Questions

## What is the Digital Data Flow initiative?

The Digital Data Flow (DDF) initiative aims to modernize clinical trials by enabling
a digital workflow that allows for automated creation of study content and
configuration of study systems to support clinical trial execution. This initiative will
establish a foundation for a future state of automated and dynamic readiness
that can transform the drug development process

## What is the objective of the DDF initiative?

The objective of DDF is to automate and expedite the Study Start-Up process by
revolutionizing how data flows across clinical trial systems, beginning with
upstream (e.g., study builder) and downstream (e.g., electronic data
capturing/EDC, clinical trial management system/CTMS) clinical systems.

TransCelerate has collaborated on the development of an open-source, vendor
agnostic, study definition repository (SDR) reference implementation, based on a Unified Study Definitions Model (USDM), developed by CDISC, that standardizes protocol study definitions.

The SDR reference implementation will enable the format of information from a
digitized protocol and other sources to be standardized, which then allows the
information to be passed to systems through application programming interfaces
(APIs) that are used for study execution and data collection, and reused
throughout the clinical development lifecycle.

In summary, DDF will combine data standards and a new technology to enable
the flow of data across all systems involved in the design and execution of a
clinical trial.

## What are the benefits of the DDF initiative?

Digital Data Flow (DDF) benefits include

- Minimized process hand-offs, data re-entry, and data format
inconsistencies across Study Start-Up and execution
- A foundation for data exchange and interoperability between clinical
technology systems, leading to greater compatibility among systems,
flexibility to sponsors, and improved clinical trial efficiencies
- A more seamless flow of data leading to accelerated Study Start-Up,
and further enabling trials automation for sponsors and research
partners
- Harmonization of the data format that can support greater
interoperability and spark innovation within the R&D ecosystem and
across the clinical trial solutions landscape

## Who does the initiative help?

This initiative will assist many organizations, including pharmaceutical companies, CROs, standards organizations, upstream and downstream clinical vendors, sites, regulatory agencies, technology companies, and the open-source
pharmaceutical and IT communities. With DDF, organizations across the R&D
ecosystem will be able to leverage the open-source code of the SDR reference
implementation and develop a framework to deploy their own SDR
implementations.

## What is the data standards solution and technology that will enable DDF?

Todayâ€™s manual processes with multiple human and technical hand offs are not
a sustainable, effective way to approach clinical development. For the future,
DDF envisions the digitization and automation of the flow of information to keep up with increasing demands of clinical development.

The DDF initiative involves a multi-faceted program that includes
collaborating with the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC)
to develop a standardized data model and working with lead collaborators and other stakeholders to develop the SDR reference implementation. The approach comprises of the following:

- **Standards Collaboration**: CDISC has developed a new protocol
study definition standard, called the Unified Study Definition Model (USDM),
with key stakeholders including engaged technology companies and
vendors
- **Study Definitions Repository Reference Implementation**: The Study Definitions Repository is a novel central component aimed at facilitating the exchange of structured study definitions across clinical systems using technical and data standards.  

The SDR Reference Implementation is a working model of the Study Definitions Repository based on the USDM, and has been deployed as open-source, and is meant to be vendor agnostic.
