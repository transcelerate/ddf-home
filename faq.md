<strong>DDF Initiative FAQ</strong>
<p></p>
<details>
<summary>What is the Digital Data Flow initiative?</summary>
<p></p>
The Digital Data Flow (DDF) initiative aims to modernize clinical trials by enabling a digital workflow that allows for automated creation of study content and configuration of study systems to support clinical trial execution. This initiative will establish a foundation for a future state of automated and dynamic readiness that can transform the drug development process.

<summary>What is the objective of the DDF initiative?</summary>
<p></p>
The objective of DDF is to automate and expedite the study start-up process by revolutionizing how data flows across clinical trial systems. The automation begins with upstream clinical systems, such as study builders, and continues with downstream clinical systems, such as electronic data capture systems (EDC) and clinical trial management systems (CTMS).
<p></p>
TransCelerate has collaborated to develop an open-source, vendor agnostic, study definition repository (SDR) reference implementation. The SDR's basis is a Unified Study Definitions Model (USDM), developed by CDISC, that standardizes protocol study definitions.
<p></p>
The SDR reference implementation enables the format of information from a digitized protocol and other sources to be standardized and stored centrally. This allows the information to be passed to systems through application programming interfaces (APIs) used for study execution and data collection and reused throughout the clinical development lifecycle.
<p></p>
In summary, DDF will combine data standards and a new technology to enable the flow of data across all systems involved in the design and execution of a clinical trial.

<strong>DDF Long Term Success FAQ</strong>
<p></p>
<details>
<summary>What is the data standards solution and technology that will enable DDF?</summary>
<p></p>
Today’s manual processes, with multiple human and technical hand offs, are not a sustainable, effective way to manage the information flow needed during clinical development. To keep up with the increasing demands on clinical development organizations, DDF envisions the digitization and automation of the information flow.
<p></p>
The DDF initiative involves a multi-faceted program that includes (a) collaborating with the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC) to develop a standardized data model and (b) working with lead collaborators and other stakeholders to develop the SDR reference implementation. The approach comprises the following:
<p></p>
<strong>Standards Collaboration</strong>: CDISC has developed a new protocol study definition standard called the Unified Study Definition Model (USDM). To develop the USDM, CDISC engaged key stakeholders, including technology companies and vendors.
<p></p>
<strong>Study Definitions Repository Reference Implementation</strong>: The study definitions repository (SDR) is a novel central component aimed at using technical and data standards to facilitate the exchange of structured study definitions across clinical systems.
<p></p>
The SDR reference implementation is a working model of the SDR based on the USDM. It has been deployed as open-source and is meant to be vendor agnostic.
<p></p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>How will TransCelerate help the research and development ecosystem prepare for DDF?</summary>
<p></p>
DDF will impact multiple stakeholders across the research and development ecosystem. TransCelerate is paying particular attention to DDF's impact on sponsors, technology solution providers, and the many stakeholders within each. Efforts to facilitate adoption and help stakeholders prepare will run across three active categories of work: analyzing, educating, and enabling stakeholder readiness for DDF execution. These efforts will account for stakeholders in sponsor companies and communities at upstream and downstream vendors.
<p></p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>How will the DDF initiative ensure long-term sustainability and outcome driven success?</summary>
<p></p>
TransCelerate designed the study definitions repository (SDR) reference implementation governance model to support long-term sustainability. As the SDR reference implementation matures, governance will transition from the SDR reference implementation governance committee to a formal SDR reference implementation governance entity. This multi-stakeholder governance entity would be a separate organization whose stakeholders and objectives align with the concepts of interoperability and vendor agnostic access. The governance entity may require additional advisory committees or members to engage stakeholders, such as additional SSOs, like ICH M11 and HL7, technology solution providers, systems integrators, and others.
<p></p>
The intent is to follow open-source principles wherever possible, and to provide transparency and involvement in developing source code for connecting applications. The choice of licensing approaches is critical. It must provide an incentive for developer and vendor communities to participate by means of commercialization of software applications or related services, such as training, documentation, integration, and support.
<p></p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>How will TransCelerate support and position DDF for success?</summary>
<p></p>
TransCelerate is uniquely positioned to catalyze this change by sponsoring and leading the collaborative project to develop (a) an open-source technology, vendor-agnostic solution in collaboration with technology organizations, and (b) corresponding data standards in collaboration with SSOs.

<strong>CDISC Unified Study Definitions Model FAQ</strong>
<p></p>
<details>
<summary>What is the Unified Study Definition Model (USDM)?</summary>
<p></p>
The study definition described in clinical trial protocol text and CDISC data and technology API standards will be augmented with a consistent, comprehensive, and structured representation, and a new standard will be defined. To this end, the Unified Study Definition Model (USDM) has been created. Study definitions in the study definition repository (SDR) conform to the USDM data standard.
<p></p>
CDISC developed the USDM. It included a class diagram describing the study design elements, their attributes, and relationships between them. The USDM defines all elements needed to construct a study definition, from high-level study design elements, such as study phase, indication, objectives and endpoints, and eligibility criteria, to detailed study design elements included in the schedule of activities and assessments.

<p></p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>How do standards developed through DDF relate to other existing standards?
</summary>
<p></p>
The idea is not to create new models but to pull together all existing standards. DDF’s collaboration with CDISC will define success from a standards perspective.
<p></p>
CDISC has led the development and maintenance of standards that the DDF solution uses. By unifying existing standards and developing new standards with input from all potential end users, we enable the accessibility, interoperability, and reusability of protocol-related study definitions data.
In addition to developing new standards, DDF will use existing standards where they exist. An example is using controlled terms for the phase of a trial.

<strong>Study Definitions Repository (SDR) FAQ</strong>
<p></p>
<details>
<summary>What is the study definition repository (SDR)?</summary>
<p></p>
The study definition repository (SDR) is a novel central component aimed at facilitating the exchange of structured study definitions across upstream systems, such as study builders, and downstream systems used to execute clinical research studies, such as electronic data capturing systems (EDC) and clinical trial management systems (CTMS). The SDR uses technical and data standards that CDISC developed.
<p></p>
The SDR reference implementation demonstrates implementation of data and technical standards defined by CDISC. It is the first step toward digital data flow and will catalyze the broader development of an ecosystem of connecting products. The SDR reference implementation will demonstrate the ability to move digital study definition information between systems through API connections to systems such as study builders, EDC systems, and CTMS, with the opportunity for many additional use cases to follow. However, these systems will not be part of the SDR reference implementation. Rather, they could be used to demonstrate the ability to send metadata, as in the case of study builders, and receive metadata, as in the case of EDC systems and CTMS.

<p></p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>Is the SDR reference implementation intended to be a commercial product?</summary>
<p></p>
No, the SDR reference implementation will not be a fully functioning product. Rather, it will be used to demonstrate and test ecosystem connectivity and interoperability. The SDR reference implementation will hopefully encourage others to develop innovative commercial products. By creating a reference implementation of an SDR, we hope to motivate vendors to align their products with it and thus incorporate the new data standards. This will allow sponsors to more readily adopt an SDR.

<p></p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>How would vendors use the SDR reference implementation?</summary>
<p></p>
Vendors can connect to the SDR reference implementation to test compatibility and use the code through open source licensing. Vendors can also take advantage of the interoperability functionality by deploying their own version in a cloud-based Software as a Service (SaaS) model or by building their own compliant SDR using a technology they choose.
<p></p>
In addition, sponsors can create an SDR based on the SDR reference implementation for their own use, adding new functionality if desired, with the ability to contribute to further development of the SDR reference implementation.

<strong>Governance on SDR reference implementation Code Updates</strong>
<p></p>
<details>
<summary>Who is part of the Collaborating Steering Committee (CSC)?</summary>
<p></p>
At the time the SDR reference implementation deploys, the Collaborating Steering Committee or "board" will comprise members from the main partners that developed the SDR, namely TransCelerate and representatives from TransCelerate member companies, CDISC, Accenture, and Microsoft.
<p></p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>How do I become a member of the CSC?</summary>
<p></p>
As the SDR reference implementation matures and is adopted by stakeholders, overall responsibility for the Collaboration Steering Committee will transition from being led mostly by TransCelerate to a new host organization that will become the formal SDR reference implementation governance entity.
<p></p>
This multi-stakeholder governance entity has not yet been determined. But it would be a separate organization whose stakeholders and objectives align with the concepts of interoperability and vendor agnostic access. The governance entity may require additional advisory committees or members to engage stakeholders, such as additional SSOs, (e.g., HL7, OHDSI, LOINC), health authorities, technology solution providers, systems integrators, and others.
